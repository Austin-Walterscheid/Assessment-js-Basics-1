// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirments
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Intergration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
